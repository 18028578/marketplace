Edited/new files: index.php, search_result.php, cv.php, dbConn.php
What was done:
-search function that searches through database for items including the search string
-if "country" filter field is filled, will only show users whose country matches or includes the string
-clicking on search will post the form to search_result.php
-search_result.php will display all the search results
-pages are not implemented, so it will be a long webpage if there are alot of hits
-clicking on hyperlink of the user's name in the reults will redirect to cv.php
-cv.php will display the selected user's info in apporiate fields
-cv.php, skills section is not yet implemented
-work experience and education uses serialized array, see below for details

Read this:
-dbConn.php also includes the alert() pop up javascript, can be used for testing
-on copying the code for the search function, the only bits needed are between line 48 to 55 in index.php
-import "users.sql" for the users table used
-users table does not include password at the moment
-to insert new rows for the table "users" use code below, can also reuse the code for profile page later on
